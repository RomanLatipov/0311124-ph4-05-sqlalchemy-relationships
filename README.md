# Flask SQLAlchemy Relationships

## Learning goals:

- Create a one to many relationship using `db.relationship` and `db.ForeignKey`

- Create a many to many relationship using `association_proxy`

## Getting Started

Fork / clone the repository and run `pipenv install` followed by `pipenv shell`. From there `cd server`.

To test your code you can use `flask shell` or use the prebuilt routes in Postman.
